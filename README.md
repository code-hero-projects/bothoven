This project is a bot that can play Piano Tiles extremely well. It's a python script that reads the screen, searches for black pixels and clicks in those pixels in order to hit the keys. There's some multithreading going on, one thread per each line.

The YouTube video for this is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJroIvNkOEE) and another video where the bot play the Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement) by Beethoven, available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSco4HixMzI).
